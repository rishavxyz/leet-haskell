# leet-haskell

Here I am solving [Leetcode's top interview questions](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/) in Haskell Î» programming language.


## Why

Because I really want to practice those questions to prepare myself but Leetcode **does not** have support for Haskell as of now.


## File name structure

In Leetcode's website, they have separated sections for topics and each of the questions have a *diffuculty* level mentioned.

Keeping in mind, I did not separate the sections by folder instead added **a prefix** in every file name *defining its section and diffuculty level*.


## The prefixes are

**Sections / Topics**

` ar ` -> Array/Strings
` ll ` -> Link Lists
` tp ` -> Two Pointers

**Diffuculty levels**

` e ` -> Easy
` m ` -> Medium
` h ` -> Hard


## Filename example

Suppose a file name like this

`are-remove-element.hs`

Here the first prefix means:

` ar ` -> **Topic** which is Array/Strings
` e ` -> **Diffuculty** which is Easy

So `are` means the file named `remove-element.hs` is from *"Array/Strings"* topic and has *Easy* diffuculty level.
